## Project info

- I figured this could be a nice forum to jot down some project notes
- Please feel free to add and expand, tried to recall plan from our last meeting

## Outline of preprocessing:
http://windstalker.pbworks.com/f/1343426443/02_Preprocessing_FIL2011May.png
- realignment
- motion correction
- coregistration
- segmentation
- spatial normalization
- smoothing
(just reiterating the above diagram, we may need more or fewer steps)

## Project overview:
- Implement and build checks for a preprocessing pipeline of a resting-state fMRI
dataset.
- Once checks have been completed, analyze the resting-state data from the different
patient and control groups in the study.
  - Start to look at different graph theory measures

## Workflow:
- Split up steps of preprocessing among different group members to research each
respective step and brainstorm possible checks to ensure the step works and
is appropriate for the data?
- [Workflow example from CPAC](http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/running.html)
